        <p>Hi, my name is Dave Koeller.  I live in Neenah, Wisconsin with my wife Kara and our Corgi Fergal.  I am currently the Kitchen Manager for the Neenah Elementary Schools.  I've spent that last 7 years in the foodservice industry and am taking a coding bootcamp through the University of Wisconsin Extention.  I've been looking at different vocations and a friend of mine who is in software development suggested that I check out a coding bootcamp.  Other than coding, I enjoy being outside, the Green Bay Packers, and hobby board games.  It would be really cool if I could take coding and somehow combine that with my love of board games.  </p>
